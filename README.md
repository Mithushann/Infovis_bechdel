# Infovis_bechdel
This is a project in the course information visualization (TNM048).

In this project we visualize the bechdel's score for movies from 1970 to 2021. We made three 
visualizations. The first one is an overview in which the percentage of the passed movies for each year is shown. The second one is a bar chart which shows all the passed and failed movies for a chosen year. The last visualization shows the information about one movie at a time.
